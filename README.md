# Gradle Embeder

A simple Gradle plugin that adds an embed configuration allowing you to embed a dependency in your jar.

## How to use

First add the plugin to your buildscript [click here to see how](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/dev.redstudio.gradleembeder).

Then simply replace any `implementation` configuration with `embed` to embed the dependency in your jar.
